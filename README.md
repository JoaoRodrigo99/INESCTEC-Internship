# CTM-16

Intership at INESCTEC
The main goal of this internship was to implement and test unimodal and multimodal machine
and deep learning models to detect the presence of the two most important glioma biomarkers (IDH1
and 1p/19q codeletion) using MRI and WSI exams separately and combined, and therefore be able to
identify the glioma type.
